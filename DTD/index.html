	<p> <i>I could say I never dare<br>
To think about you in that way, but<br>
I would be lyin'<br>
And I pretend I'm happy for you<br>
When you find some dude to take home<br>
But I won't deny that<br>
<br>
In the midst of the crowds<br>
In the shapes in the clouds<br>
I don't see nobody but you<br>
<br>
In my rose-tinted dreams<br>
Wrinkled silk on my sheets<br>
I don't see nobody but you<br>
Boy, you got me hooked onto something<br>
Who could say that they saw us coming?<br>
Tell me<br>
Do you feel the love?<br>
<br>
Spend a summer or a lifetime with me<br>
Let me take you to the place of your dreams<br>
Tell me<br>
Do you feel the love?<br>
And I could say I never unzipped<br>
Those blue Levi's inside my head<br>
But that's far from the truth<br>
Don't know what's come over me<br>
It seems like yesterday when I said<br>
"We'll be friends forever"<br>
<br>
Constellations of stars<br>
Murals on city walls<br>
I don't see nobody but you<br>
<br>
You're my vice, you're my muse<br>
You're a nineteenth floor view<br>
I don't see nobody but you<br>
Boy, you got me hooked onto something<br>
Who could say that they saw us coming?<br>
Tell me<br>
Do you feel the love?<br>
<br>
Spend a summer or a lifetime with me<br>
Let me take you to the place of your dreams<br>
Tell me<br>
Do you feel the love?<br>
<br>
Boy, you got me hooked onto something<br>
Who could say that they saw us coming?<br>
Tell me<br>
Do you feel the love?<br>
Spend a summer or a lifetime with me<br>
Let me take you to the place of your dreams<br>
Tell me<br>
Do you feel the love?<br>
<br>
Do you feel the love?<br>
Do you feel the love?<br>
Do you feel the love?<br>
Do you feel the love?<br>
Feel the love<br>
Do you feel the love?<br>
