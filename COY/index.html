	<p> <i>It started with a kiss on your mama's couch <br>
2012 was nothing serious<br>
I know we caught the feels, it got really real<br>
Too good to be true, I guess I thought you was, yeah<br>
Why did I run away, run away, run away?<br>
Oh, your love was everything, everything, everything<br>
I know it's gettin' late, gettin' late, gettin' late<br>
But can I still be on my way, on my way? Yeah<br>
I know I said goodbye and baby, you said it too<br>
But when I touch her I feel like I'm cheating on you<br>
I thought that I'd be better when I found someone new<br>
But when I touch her I feel like I'm cheating on you<br>
Baby now, oh-oh-oh<br>
Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
Cheating on you<br>
Baby now, oh-oh-oh<br>
But when I touch her I feel like I'm cheating on you<br>
Thought I could get you back any time of day<br>
Shouldn't have been so cocky<br>
Shouldn't have did you wrong (woah, oh)<br>
And now I miss you bad, really, really bad<br>
Guess you don't know what you got until it's gone<br>
Why did I run away, run away, run away? (Run away)<br>
Oh, your love was everything, everything, everything (everything)<br>
I know it's getting late, getting late, getting late (getting late)<br>
But can I still be on my way, on my way? Yeah<br>
I know I said goodbye and baby, you said it too (you said it too, baby)<br>
But when I touch her I feel like I'm cheating on you (I'm cheating on you)<br>
I thought that I'd be better when I found someone new (ooh)<br>
But when I touch her I feel like I'm cheating on you<br>
Baby now, oh-oh-oh<br>
Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
Cheating on you<br>
Baby now, oh-oh-oh<br>
But when I touch her I feel like I'm cheating on you<br>
Baby, no<br>
There ain't no lips like your lips<br>
And nobody else feels like this<br>
There's no moving on, I'll admit<br>
If you go away<br>
Yeah, ah<br>
I know I said goodbye and baby, you said it too<br>
But when I touch her I feel like I'm cheating on you (I'm cheating on you)<br>
I thought that I'd be better when I found someone new (found someone new)<br>
But when I touch her I feel like I'm cheating on you (believe it, baby)<br>
Baby now, oh-oh-oh<br>
Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
Cheating on you<br>
Baby now, oh-oh-oh<br>
But when I touch her I feel like I'm cheating on you<br>
You said goodbye<br>
And you said goodbye<br>
