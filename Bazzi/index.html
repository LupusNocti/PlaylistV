	<p> <i>I'm still on your Netflix <br>
Girl, I know you love me<br>
Even though your parents<br>
They don't fucking trust me<br>
They probably alright though<br>
I know I'm an asshole<br>
No reply to all your texts girl I do you mad cold<br>
Like you're just<br>
Dying to drive but you can't find the keys, now<br>
Looking for God but you're down on your knees, I'm<br>
All that you want but not what you need girl why<br>
Tell me why do you still love me<br>
Why do you love me?<br>
You know you shouldn't love me<br>
Yea you still love me<br>
All your friends tell you they hate me<br>
God I'm fuckin' shady<br>
Couple weeks ago they were inside my sheets naked<br>
Club, so you can Snapchat<br>
Titties out to snap that<br>
I know that you do that shit just hoping for a snapback<br>
Like you're just<br>
Dying to drive but you can't find the keys, now<br>
Looking for God but you're down on your knees, I'm<br>
All that you want but not what you need girl why<br>
Tell me why do you still love me<br>
Why do you love me?<br>
You know you shouldn't love me<br>
Yea you still love me, oh<br>
Why do you need me when you know you don't need me?<br>
It's tearing you apart<br>
I leave you broken and shaken<br>
And you still call me baby<br>
Tell me why do you still love me<br>
Why do you love me?<br>
You know you shouldn't love me<br>
Yea you still love me <br>
